# Drone-based photogrammetry combined with deep-learning to estimate hail size distributions and melting of hail on the ground

Hail is a major threat associated with severe thunderstorms and estimating the hail size is important for issuing warnings to the public. For the validation of existing, operational, radar-derived hail estimates, ground-based observations are necessary. Automatic hail sensors record the kinetic energy of hailstones to estimate the hail sizes. Due to the small size of the observational area of these sensors, the full hail size distribution (HSD) cannot be retrieved. 

A state-of-the-art custom trained deep-learning object detection model (https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) is applied to drone-based aerial photogrammetric data (2D orthomosaic model) to identify hailstones and estimate the HSD.
